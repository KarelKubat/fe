Installation Instructions for the Fast and the Furious
------------------------------------------------------


1. Create Makefile.local

Create a file Makefile.local. In this file you must configure a
built-in "magic" string that will be used to encrypt internal data
structures. For example:

    # Makefile.local 
    MAGIC = This is my builtin secret passphrase

Choose a good passphrase. E.g., visit
https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm and copy one of the passphrases that
are uniquely generated on that page for each visitor. Or let your
favorite broswer plugin such as LastPass generate one.

Back up this Makefile.local to a secure spot, or write down your top
secret passphrase for a next time. You might need it if you need to
rebuild fe. If you rebuild fe with a different magic, then you won't
be able to transcrypt files encrypted with a previous version.


2. Type "make"

This will make a local build.


3. Installation

Type "make install". You might want to do this as user root (e.g., via
"sudo"), because the installation target directories are
/usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin.


4. Sanity checking

Type "make test". This will run a number of (simple) checks to prove
the sanity of the installed software.
