Installation Instructions for the Fast and the Furious
------------------------------------------------------


1. Create Makefile.local

Create a file Makefile.local. In this file you must configure a
built-in "magic" string that will be used to encrypt internal data

    MAGIC = This is my builtin secret passphrase

Choose a good passphrase. E.g., visit
https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm and copy one of the passphrases that

Back up this Makefile.local to a 


2. Type "make"

/usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin.


4. Sanity checking

Type "make test". This will run a number of (simple) checks to prove
the sanity of the installed software.
